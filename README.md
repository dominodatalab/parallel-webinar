# Examples used in our webinar on parallel programming

1. `joblib example.ipynb` has sample code for using joblib
2. `05 - Model Selection and Assessment.ipynb` is one of Olivier Gisel's notebooks from his PyCon 2013 talk, modified slightly to show n_jobs in scikit-learn
3. `cluster example.ipynb` shows some basics of using IPython Clusters.
4. `parallel_demo.R` has sample parllel R code.

The slides are also in the repo, as a PDF. The slides contain links to more details on many of the packages I use in the demo code.
